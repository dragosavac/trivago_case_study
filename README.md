# trivago_case_study

This is the case study for Trivago A/B testing. I've been using Python 3.7, Data Science packages and Jupyter notebook   

If you want to run the code, you should create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies(packages).
I've also added an HTML file of a study, just to be easier to you to see it. 
If you want to run the code, just follow the instructions

##### Creating virtual environment
 python3 -m venv <name of the venv> 

##### Activate virtual environment
 ~ .venv/bin/activate
   
##### Install necessary dependencies(packages)
 * pip3 install pandas
 * pip3 install numpy
 * pip3 install matplotlib
 * pip3 install seaborn
 * pip3 install scipy
   
##### Install jupyter notebook
* pip install jupyterlab
* pip install notebook
   
##### Run Jupyter Notebook from file where you've downloaded source code
*  cd trivago_case_study 
*  jupyter notebook

##### Alow Jupyter Notebook to run venv and activate venv in Jupyter Notebook 
* pip install --user ipykernel
* python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
 
 
##### Also, you can activate venv that I've sent to you:
~ . trivago/bin/activate
   
##### I've also added an HTML of jupyter notebook case study
