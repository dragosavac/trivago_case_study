# trivago_case_study

This is the case study for Trivago A/B testing. I've been using Python 3.7, Data Science packages and Jupyter notebook   

Easiest way to run the code is to enter CaseStudyNotebook folder and open TrivagoCaseStudy.ipynb file in jupyter notebook, install dependencies and you'll be able to access all cells in that notebook.

If you want setup environment from begining, you should create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies(packages) or you can activate venv that I've sent to you and follow the instructions bellow.

##### Creating virtual environment
 python3 -m venv <name of the venv> 
 
 ##### Also, you can activate venv that I've sent to you:
~ . trivago/bin/activate
   
##### Activate virtual environment
 ~ .venv/bin/activate
   
##### Install necessary dependencies(packages)
 * pip3 install pandas
 * pip3 install numpy
 * pip3 install matplotlib
 * pip3 install seaborn
 * pip3 install scipy
   
##### Install jupyter notebook
* pip install jupyterlab
* pip install notebook
   
##### Run Jupyter Notebook from file where you've downloaded source code
*  cd trivago_case_study 
*  jupyter notebook

##### Alow Jupyter Notebook to run venv and activate venv in Jupyter Notebook 
* pip install --user ipykernel
* python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
